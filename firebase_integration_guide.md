## Adding Firebase to Your Flutter App

### Step 1: Install Required Dependencies

Add the following dependencies to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  firebase_core: ^2.15.0
  firebase_auth: ^4.7.2
  cloud_firestore: ^4.8.4
  firebase_storage: ^11.2.5
  google_sign_in: ^6.1.4
  provider: ^6.0.5
  http: ^1.1.0
  shared_preferences: ^2.2.0
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the dependencies.

### Step 2: Configure Firebase for Android

1. In the Firebase Console, click on your project
2. Click on the Android icon to add an Android app
3. Enter your app's package name (e.g., `com.ironcompany.ecommerce`)
   - You can find this in your `android/app/build.gradle` file under `applicationId`
4. Enter a nickname for your app (optional)
5. Enter your app's SHA-1 signing certificate (optional but recommended for Google Sign-In)
   - You can get this by running `./gradlew signingReport` in the `android` directory
6. Click "Register app"
7. Download the `google-services.json` file
8. Place the file in the `android/app` directory of your Flutter project
9. Add the Firebase SDK to your project by modifying the following files:

In `android/build.gradle`, add:
```gradle
buildscript {
    dependencies {
        // ... other dependencies
        classpath 'com.google.gms:google-services:4.3.15'
    }
}
```

In `android/app/build.gradle`, add at the bottom:
```gradle
apply plugin: 'com.google.gms.google-services'
```

### Step 3: Configure Firebase for iOS (if applicable)

1. In the Firebase Console, click on your project
2. Click on the iOS icon to add an iOS app
3. Enter your app's bundle ID (e.g., `com.ironcompany.ecommerce`)
   - You can find this in your `ios/Runner.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj` file
4. Enter a nickname for your app (optional)
5. Click "Register app"
6. Download the `GoogleService-Info.plist` file
7. Place the file in the `ios/Runner` directory of your Flutter project
8. Open Xcode, right-click on the Runner directory, and select "Add Files to 'Runner'"
9. Select the `GoogleService-Info.plist` file and click "Add"

### Step 4: Initialize Firebase in Your App

Create a file called `firebase_options.dart` in your `lib` directory with the following content:

```dart
import 'package:firebase_core/firebase_core.dart';

class DefaultFirebaseOptions {
  static FirebaseOptions get currentPlatform {
    // Replace with your actual Firebase project configuration
    return const FirebaseOptions(
      apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
      authDomain: "your-app.firebaseapp.com",
      projectId: "your-app-id",
      storageBucket: "your-app.appspot.com",
      messagingSenderId: "123456789012",
      appId: "1:123456789012:web:abc123def456ghi789jkl",
      measurementId: "G-MEASUREMENT_ID",
    );
  }
}
```

Replace the placeholder values with your actual Firebase project configuration, which you can find in the Firebase Console.

Then, initialize Firebase in your `main.dart` file:

```dart
import 'package:firebase_core/firebase_core.dart';
import 'firebase_options.dart';

void main() async {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  await Firebase.initializeApp(
    options: DefaultFirebaseOptions.currentPlatform,
  );
  runApp(MyApp());
}
```

## Firebase Authentication Setup

### Step 1: Enable Authentication Methods

1. In the Firebase Console, go to "Authentication" > "Sign-in method"
2. Enable the authentication methods you want to use:
   - Email/Password
   - Google
   - Phone (if needed)
   - Other providers as required

### Step 2: Implement Authentication in Your App

The app already includes an `AuthService` class that handles authentication. Make sure it's properly initialized in your app:

```dart
// In your main.dart or app initialization
final firebaseService = FirebaseService();
final authService = AuthService(firebaseService: firebaseService);

// Provide these services to your app
return MultiProvider(
  providers: [
    Provider<FirebaseService>(create: (_) => firebaseService),
    Provider<AuthService>(create: (_) => authService),
    ChangeNotifierProvider<UserModel>(
      create: (_) => UserModel(firebaseService: firebaseService),
    ),
    // Other providers...
  ],
  child: MaterialApp(
    // Your app configuration...
  ),
);
```

## Firestore Database Setup

### Step 1: Create Firestore Database

1. In the Firebase Console, go to "Firestore Database"
2. Click "Create database"
3. Choose "Start in production mode" or "Start in test mode" (for development)
4. Select a location for your database
5. Click "Enable"

### Step 2: Set Up Security Rules

1. Go to the "Rules" tab in Firestore
2. Set up basic security rules:

```
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Allow authenticated users to read all documents
    match /{document=**} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
    }
    
    // Allow users to read and write their own data
    match /users/{userId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
    
    // Allow authenticated users to read products
    match /products/{productId} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
    }
    
    // Allow authenticated users to read categories
    match /categories/{categoryId} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
    }
    
    // Allow users to manage their own cart
    match /carts/{cartId} {
      allow read, write, delete: if request.auth != null && request.resource.data.userId == request.auth.uid;
    }
    
    // Allow users to create and read their own orders
    match /orders/{orderId} {
      allow create: if request.auth != null && request.resource.data.userId == request.auth.uid;
      allow read: if request.auth != null && resource.data.userId == request.auth.uid;
    }
  }
}
```

### Step 3: Create Initial Collections

Create the following collections in Firestore:

1. `users` - To store user information
2. `products` - To store product information
3. `categories` - To store product categories
4. `carts` - To store user cart items
5. `orders` - To store user orders

## Firebase Storage Setup

### Step 1: Set Up Firebase Storage

1. In the Firebase Console, go to "Storage"
2. Click "Get started"
3. Choose "Start in production mode" or "Start in test mode" (for development)
4. Select a location for your storage
5. Click "Done"

### Step 2: Set Up Security Rules

1. Go to the "Rules" tab in Storage
2. Set up basic security rules:

```
rules_version = '2';
service firebase.storage {
  match /b/{bucket}/o {
    // Allow authenticated users to read all files
    match /{allPaths=**} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
    }
    
    // Allow authenticated users to upload product images
    match /products/{productId}/{fileName} {
      allow write: if request.auth != null && 
                     request.resource.size < 5 * 1024 * 1024 && // 5MB
                     request.resource.contentType.matches('image/.*');
    }
    
    // Allow users to upload their profile images
    match /users/{userId}/{fileName} {
      allow write: if request.auth != null && 
                     request.auth.uid == userId &&
                     request.resource.size < 5 * 1024 * 1024 && // 5MB
                     request.resource.contentType.matches('image/.*');
    }
  }
}
```
